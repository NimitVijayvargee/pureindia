      <h1>Welcome to Jharkhand!</h1>
      <img src="photos/jh.png" style="max-width: 700px;"><br>
      Jharkhand, located in eastern India, is a state known for its rich tribal heritage, natural resources, and
      cultural diversity. The land of forests and hills, Jharkhand's culture is deeply rooted in its tribal traditions,
      folk art forms, festivals, and historical landmarks.

      <br><br>

      Festivals in Jharkhand are vibrant celebrations that highlight the state's cultural diversity and traditional
      practices. Sarhul, a spring festival celebrated by tribal communities, marks the beginning of the agricultural
      season with prayers to the Earth Goddess. The Tusu Parab festival, dedicated to the deity Tusu, involves singing
      traditional songs and offering prayers for a good harvest. Karma Puja, celebrated by Oraon and Munda tribes, is
      another significant festival characterized by communal dancing, singing, and rituals.

      <br><br>

      Jharkhandi cuisine is influenced by its tribal communities and agricultural lifestyle. Rice is a staple food,
      often accompanied by dal (lentils), vegetables, and seasonal greens. Dishes like Chhilka Roti (rice flour bread),
      Handia (rice beer), and Pittha (dumplings) are popular among locals. The use of locally sourced ingredients and
      traditional cooking methods reflect the state's culinary heritage.

      <br><br>

      Music and dance form an integral part of Jharkhand's cultural expressions. Tribal music genres like Dhols,
      Nagaras, and Banam (a string instrument) are used in folk songs that narrate tales of nature, bravery, and daily
      life. Dance forms like Chhau, Seraikella Chhau, and Jhumair are performed during festivals and cultural events,
      showcasing intricate footwork, vibrant costumes, and rhythmic movements. These cultural practices are passed down
      through generations, preserving Jharkhand's unique artistic heritage.

      <br><br>

      Jharkhand's architectural heritage includes ancient temples, rock art, and archaeological sites that reflect its
      historical significance. The Parasnath Hill in Giridih is revered by Jains and features Jain temples dating back
      to the 18th century. The Palamau Fort, an ancient fortification in Latehar district, and the rock paintings of
      Isko, depicting prehistoric life, are notable examples of Jharkhand's archaeological wealth.

      <br><br>

      Handicrafts in Jharkhand showcase the artistic skills of its tribal communities, with products ranging from
      hand-woven textiles (such as Tussar silk sarees) to bamboo and woodcrafts. Dokra metal craft, known for its
      intricate designs and traditional methods of casting, is a highlight of Jharkhandi handicrafts. Artisans in
      regions like Hazaribagh and Dumka create unique artworks that blend tradition with contemporary designs,
      contributing to the state's cultural heritage and rural economy.

      <br><br>

      Natural beauty is abundant in Jharkhand, with lush forests, waterfalls, and wildlife sanctuaries offering scenic
      landscapes and eco-tourism opportunities. The Betla National Park, renowned for its tiger population and diverse
      flora and fauna, attracts nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers. Rivers like Subarnarekha, Damodar, and
      Mayurakshi provide picturesque settings for boating, fishing, and picnicking, adding to the state's natural charm.

      <br><br>

      In conclusion, Jharkhand's culture is a tapestry of tribal traditions, festivals, cuisine, music, dance,
      handicrafts, and natural beauty. Its deep-rooted heritage and artistic expressions make it a fascinating
      destination for travelers seeking to explore India's tribal culture and experience the serenity of its natural
      landscapes.
