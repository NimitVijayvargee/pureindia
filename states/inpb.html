      <h1>Welcome to Punjab!</h1>
      <img src="photos/pb.png" style="max-width: 700px;"><br>
      Punjab, located in northwestern India, is renowned for its vibrant culture, rich history, agricultural prosperity,
      and warm hospitality. Known as the "Land of Five Rivers," Punjab's cultural identity is shaped by its agricultural
      heritage, religious diversity, traditional festivals, and culinary delights.

      <br><br>

      Agricultural Heartland: Punjab is often referred to as the "Granary of India" due to its fertile soil and
      extensive agricultural practices. The state is a leading producer of wheat, rice, and other crops, contributing
      significantly to India's food security. The rural landscape is dotted with lush green fields, sprawling farms, and
      picturesque mustard fields during the winter season, adding to Punjab's scenic charm.

      <br><br>

      Religious Diversity: Punjab is a melting pot of religions and spiritual traditions. The state is home to
      important religious sites for Sikhism, including the Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib) in Amritsar, the holiest
      shrine for Sikhs worldwide. Other significant Sikh pilgrimage sites include Anandpur Sahib, the birthplace of the
      Khalsa, and Takht Sri Patna Sahib, associated with Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Punjab also has Hindu temples, mosques,
      and churches, reflecting its religious harmony and diversity.

      <br><br>

      Cultural Festivals: Punjab celebrates various festivals with great fervor, reflecting its cultural vibrancy
      and traditional values. Baisakhi, also known as Vaisakhi, is a major festival marking the Sikh New Year and the
      harvest season. The festival is celebrated with colorful processions (Nagar Kirtan), folk music (Bhangra and
      Gidda), traditional dance performances, and community feasts (Langar). Lohri, celebrated in January, marks the
      winter solstice with bonfires, music, and dancing.

      <br><br>

      Traditional Arts and Crafts: Punjab's artistic traditions are reflected in its vibrant handicrafts, including
      Phulkari embroidery, which features intricate floral patterns stitched on textiles. The state's artisans are also
      known for their skill in creating Punjabi juttis (traditional footwear), woodwork, and pottery. These crafts
      showcase Punjab's artistic heritage and craftsmanship passed down through generations.

      <br><br>

      Cuisine: Punjabi cuisine is renowned for its rich flavors and hearty dishes, influenced by the state's
      agricultural abundance and cultural diversity. Staple foods include wheat-based breads like Roti, Naan, and
      Paratha, often paired with Dal (lentils), vegetables, and dairy products. Iconic dishes include Butter Chicken,
      Sarson Ka Saag (mustard greens), Makki Ki Roti (cornbread), and Punjabi Lassi (yogurt-based drink). Sweets like
      Jalebi, Gulab Jamun, and Pinni are enjoyed during festivals and celebrations.

      <br><br>

      Music and Dance: Punjab's cultural heritage is enriched by its lively music and dance forms. Bhangra, a
      traditional dance performed by men during harvest celebrations, is characterized by energetic movements and
      rhythmic beats of the dhol (drum) and other instruments. Gidda, performed by women, is a graceful dance form
      accompanied by folk songs that celebrate love, joy, and cultural pride. These vibrant expressions of music and
      dance are integral to Punjab's festive spirit and cultural identity.

      <br><br>

      Modern Punjab: Urban centers like Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab and Haryana, embody modernity with their
      planned layouts, green spaces, and architectural landmarks. Chandigarh, designed by renowned architect Le
      Corbusier, blends modernist architecture with Punjabi culture and serves as a hub for education, commerce, and
      administration in the region.

      <br><br>

      In conclusion, Punjab's cultural richness, religious heritage, agricultural prosperity, and warm hospitality make
      it a captivating destination for travelers seeking a blend of tradition, spirituality, and culinary delights in
      India's northwestern region. Its festivals, handicrafts, music, and cuisine reflect the vibrant spirit of Punjab
      and its people.
