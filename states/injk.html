      <h1>Welcome to Jammu and Kashmir!</h1>
      <img src="photos/jk.png" style="max-width: 700px;"><br>
      Jammu and Kashmir, located in the northernmost part of India, is known for its stunning landscapes, diverse
      culture, and rich history. It is divided into three regions: Jammu, Kashmir Valley, and Ladakh, each offering
      unique cultural experiences and natural beauty.

      <br><br>

      Jammu: Jammu is known for its temples, shrines, and historic forts. The region is culturally diverse, with
      influences from Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim traditions. The Vaishno Devi Temple, a pilgrimage site dedicated to
      Goddess Vaishnavi, attracts millions of devotees annually. Other significant temples include Raghunath Temple,
      Bahu Fort, and Ranbireshwar Temple. Jammu's cuisine features dishes like Rajma Chawal, Kaladi Kulcha, and Dogra
      cuisine specialties.

      <br><br>

      Kashmir Valley: The Kashmir Valley is renowned for its breathtaking landscapes, including serene lakes like
      Dal Lake and Wular Lake, surrounded by the Himalayas. Srinagar, the summer capital, is famous for its houseboats,
      Mughal gardens (such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh), and the historic Shankaracharya Temple. Kashmiri cuisine
      is known for its aromatic dishes like Rogan Josh, Yakhni, and Wazwan, a traditional multi-course meal served
      during weddings and festivals.

      <br><br>

      Ladakh: Ladakh is a high-altitude desert known for its Tibetan Buddhist culture and stunning landscapes. The
      region's monasteries, including Hemis, Thiksey, and Diskit, are centers of Buddhist spirituality and architecture.
      Leh, the largest town in Ladakh, offers trekking opportunities, Buddhist festivals like Hemis Festival, and
      panoramic views of the Himalayas. Ladakhi cuisine features dishes like Momos, Thukpa (noodle soup), and Skyu (a
      hearty stew).

      <br><br>

      Cultural festivals in Jammu and Kashmir include Baisakhi, Eid, Diwali, and Navratri, celebrated with traditional
      music, dance, and rituals that reflect the region's religious and cultural diversity. Handicrafts such as Pashmina
      shawls, Kashmiri carpets, wooden artifacts, and papier-mâché items are famous worldwide for their craftsmanship
      and intricate designs.

      <br><br>

      Despite its scenic beauty and cultural richness, the region has faced challenges related to political instability.
      However, efforts are continually made to promote tourism and preserve its unique cultural heritage, making Jammu
      and Kashmir a captivating destination for travelers seeking both natural beauty and cultural experiences in India.
